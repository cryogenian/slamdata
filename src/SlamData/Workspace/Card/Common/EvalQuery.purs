-- | The query algebra shared by the inner parts of a card component.
-- |
-- | - `EvalCard` is a command sent from the deck when a card component needs
-- |   updating during the evaluation process. An input value from the previous
-- |   card in the deck is provided, along with the output from the card's model
-- |   evaluator. The card cannot return a new port value, it's eval is only
-- |   allowed to update the card component state.
-- |
-- | - `Activate` is sent when the card component becomes the active card.
-- |
-- | - `Save` requests the current model value for the card, used when
-- |   serialising model and when running the cards in a deck.
-- |
-- | - `Load` attempts to populate the card with a model value. This function
-- |   is partial, in the sense that the passed model should use the appropriate
-- |   constructor for the card type. The behaviour is unspecified when a
-- |   mismatched value is passed in.
-- |
-- | - `SetDimensions` is used to notify the card of the size of the deck upon
-- |   resize and initialisation.
