-- | This applies to two types of card components:

-- | 1. Parent components where the parent uses `CardEvalQuery` directly, in
-- |    which case `f` will be some `ChildF`.
-- | 2. Self contained components with an enriched query algebra, where `f`
-- |    will be the component's own internal algebra.
